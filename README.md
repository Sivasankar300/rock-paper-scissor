A Rock Papers Scissors Project part of The Odin Project's Curriculum.

This project focuses on deepening my knowledge of functions, Operators as well as letting me get used to them outside of isolated exercises. Lesson link: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors.

It was revisited later and was given an UI, Which deepened my knowledge of Event Listeners and the DOM. Lesson Link: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors
